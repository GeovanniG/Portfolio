## Portfolio Site

This is where you can find my projects that I care about most. Projects here range from simple to semi-complex. So far I have built projects
in languages such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB. My projects have also tools such as React, Node, Express, Sass, and a few more.

This site was primarily built with React. Later it may get completely remade using a different framework.

If you notice/have any issues while browsing, or feel as though the site needs a redesign, let me know. My portfolio will always remain a work in progress.
