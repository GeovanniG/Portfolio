                <p>Hello, my name is Geovanni Gonzalez, but you may call me Geo. I am a recent UCI college graduate
                and am now looking to join a software company that values passionate developers.</p>
                <p>My journey in programming began back in 2014 where I learned the basics of both HTML and CSS. 
                Since then, I have had the luxury of testing a wide array of languages. From Java to Matlab and now
                javascript.</p>
                <p>These days I mainly find myself programming for the Web using React for the front-end and
                Node.js for the back-end. My journey will not end here. In the future I plan to test different areas of 
                software engineering.</p>
